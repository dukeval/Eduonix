# EmployeeManagement

- You have 2 options – Create another management CRUD system of your choice (User management, Ecommerce management, etc) or build on this (login and registration, authentication – beautify the app, and so on).
- Design it to the fullest with animations and CSS. Play around with the app.
- Add more features.
- Add test cases to every single feature/component/service in the app. Think of everything the user will encounter and add test cases to all of that. Once you’ve created the app, run all the tests and debug.
- Create an online server (mock/fake api) and deploy the app.
